# Melanoma-Classification
These are the files for my final project for the Advanced Data Science with IBM Specialization on Coursera. The data behind this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification, as part of the SIIM-ISC Melanoma classification hackathon on Kaggle. The files include a notebook (.ipynb) containing the entirety of the code, an Architectural Decision Document, and a PowerPoint presentation. A presentation video can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f7ASvjvarA
